# Labs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1 and modified to the challenge by Marco Cabrera on 2022-02-13.

As always, this application could go deeper and deeper, but I stopped where it is to honor the 3 hour max.  I would have loved to have brought in NgRx to store data so each click of a route didn't 
need to re-query the API.

I also removed all .spec files to save weight for transfer, but also as I didn't plan in time for unit testing.

Thank you so much for your time.
